Agent:
"Hi Mario's, this is Alex from FlipTable. I have 23 customers with money already escrowed wanting pizza in your area tonight. They've committed $207 total, willing to pay $6-12 per pizza. What surplus do you have? I can guarantee you sell everything you name in the next 10 minutes."

Restaurant:
"Uh, wow, okay. Let me check... We have 8 Margherita pizzas and 6 Pepperoni pizzas left."

Agent:
"Perfect, so 14 pizzas total. My buyers' average bid is $9. I can take all 14 at $8 each. That's $112 guaranteed revenue right now instead of throwing them away. Deal?"

Restaurant:
"Yeah, absolutely! $112 is way better than zero. Let's do it."

Agent:
"Great! You'll see 14 orders coming through your tablet in the next 2 minutes. Buyers will show QR codes for pickup between 7-8 PM. Money hits your account as soon as they scan. Thanks, talk tomorrow at 6!"
